World "EquivalenceRelation"

Level 2


variable {S :Type*}


Introduction "The following statement proves that the equality relation ($ = $) on a type $S$ is an equivalence relation. An equivalence relation must satisfy three properties: reflexivity (every element is equal to itself), symmetry (if $x = y$ then $y = x$), and transitivity (if $x = y$ and $y = z$ then $x = z$)."

Statement (preamble := constructor ) : Equivalence (α := S) (· = ·) := by
  Hint (hidden := true) "We need to prove three cases: reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity. The first case is reflexivity, where we need to show $∀ (x : S), x = x$. We start by introducing an arbitrary element x of type {S}."
  intro x
  Hint (hidden := true) "The reflexivity case is straightforward because $x = x$ is true by definition. We can use the `rfl` tactic to close this goal."
  rfl
  Hint (hidden := true) "Next, we tackle the symmetry case: $∀ x y : S, x = y → y = x$. We introduce x and y as well as the hypothesis hxy that $x = y$."
  intro x y hxy
  Hint (hidden := true) "To prove $y = x$, we can rewrite the goal using the hypothesis {hxy}, which changes the goal to $x = x$. This is again true by reflexivity."
  rw [hxy]
  Hint (hidden := true) "Finally, we address the transitivity case: $∀ x y z : S, x = y → y = z → x = z$. We introduce x, y, z, and the hypotheses hxy ($x = y$) and hyz ($y = z$)."
  intro x y z hxy hyz
  Hint (hidden := true) "To prove $x = z$, we first rewrite the goal using {hxy}, changing it to $y = z$."
  rw [hxy]
  Hint (hidden := true) "The goal is now exactly our hypothesis {hyz}, so we can close it with `exact {hyz}`."
  exact hyz
