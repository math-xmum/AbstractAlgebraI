Introduction "The following statement claims that if $e$ is a multiplicative identity in a structure $α$, then its image under a multiplicative equivalence $φ$ is also a multiplicative identity in the structure $β$. This is a fundamental property of multiplicative equivalences, showing that they preserve multiplicative identities."

Statement (e : α) (he: Mul.isIdentity e) (φ : α ≃* β): Mul.isIdentity (φ e) := by
  Hint "Let's start by unfolding the definition of `Mul.isIdentity` to see what we need to prove."
  unfold Mul.isIdentity at he
  Hint "We need to prove that for any element $x'$ in $β$, both $x' * φ (e) = x'$ and $φ(e) * x' = x'$. Let's introduce $x'$."
  intro x'
  Hint "To use our hypothesis {he}, we need to relate $x'$ in $β$ to some element in $α$. Note that φ is an isomorphism, the inverse of φ is called `{φ}.symm` in Mathlib. Let's define $y$ as the image of $x'$ under {φ}.symm. Use `let y := φ.symm x'`"
  let y := φ.symm x'
  Hint "Now we need to establish the relationship between $x'$ and $φ(y)$. By definition of the inverse of an equivalence, we have $x' = φ(y)$. One can use `have hx' : φ (y) = x' := MulEquiv.apply_symm_apply _ _`"
  have hx' : φ (y) = x' := MulEquiv.apply_symm_apply _ _
  Hint "Let's substitute $x'$ with $φ(y)$ in our goal."
  rw [<-hx']
  Hint "Now we can use our hypothesis {he} with the specific element $y$ we defined."
  specialize he y
  Hint "We need to prove two properties: $φ(y) * φ(e) = φ(y)$ and $φ(e) * φ(y) = φ(y)$. Let's break this into two cases."
  constructor
  Hint "For the first case, we can use the fact that $φ$ preserves multiplication, so $φ(y) * φ(e) = φ(y * e)$."
  rw [<- MulEquiv.map_mul]
  Hint "Now we can use the first part of {he}, which states that $y * e = y$."
  rw [he.1]
  Hint "For the second case, we again use the fact that $φ$ preserves multiplication."
  rw [<- MulEquiv.map_mul]
  Hint "Finally, we use the second part of {he}, which states that $e * y = y$."
  rw [he.2]
