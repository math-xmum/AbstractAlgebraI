Introduction "
Recall that a magma is a set `G` with a binary operation `*` such that `a * b` is well-defined for all `a, b` in  `G`.

The following statement claims that the set of positive real numbers forms a magma under multiplication. A magma is simply a set with a binary operation that is closed under that operation.
"

Statement : Set.isMagma {x : ℝ | x > 0} := by
  Hint "We need to show that the set of positive real numbers is closed under multiplication. Let's unfold the definition of `Set.isMagma`."
  unfold Set.isMagma
  Hint "Now we need to prove that for any two positive real numbers, their product is also positive. Let's introduce the variables and hypotheses."
  intro x y hx hy
  Hint "We need to show that the product x * y belongs to the set of positive real numbers. Let's rewrite the goal using the set membership definition."
  rw [Set.mem_setOf_eq]
  Hint "Now we need to prove that x * y > 0. We can use the theorem `mul_pos` which states that the product of two positive numbers is positive."
  apply mul_pos
  Hint "For the first subgoal, we need to show that x > 0. This follows directly from our hypothesis {hx}."
  exact hx
  Hint "For the second subgoal, we need to show that y > 0. This follows directly from our hypothesis {hy}."
