Introduction "The following statement claims that there is no multiplicative equivalence between the complex numbers $ℂ$ and the real numbers $ℝ$. This means there cannot exist a bijection between these two fields that preserves multiplication."

Statement: IsEmpty (ℂ ≃* ℝ) := by
  Hint "To prove that a type is empty, we need to show that assuming an element of that type leads to a contradiction. We can use `IsEmpty.mk` which takes a function that maps any potential element to `False`."
  apply IsEmpty.mk
  Hint "Now we need to show that any multiplicative equivalence between $ℂ$ and $ℝ$ leads to a contradiction. Let's introduce such a hypothetical equivalence `f`."
  intro f
  Hint "Let's define a complex number x by applying the inverse of {f} to $-1$. This will be a key element in our proof."
  let x := f.symm (-1)
  Hint "We can establish that {f} maps {x} to $-1$ using the property of multiplicative equivalences that applying a function and then its inverse gives the original value.
  Use `have hx : f {x} = -1 := MulEquiv.apply_symm_apply _ _`
  "
  have hx : f x = -1 := MulEquiv.apply_symm_apply _ _
  Hint "Now we'll use a property of complex numbers: for any complex number {x}, ({x}^\{1/2})^2 = {x}. This is crucial for our contradiction. Please use `have H := Complex.cpow_nat_inv_pow x (by decide : 2 ≠ 0)` "
  have H := Complex.cpow_nat_inv_pow x (by decide : 2 ≠ 0)
  Hint "For technical reason, we should simplify the notation in {H} by normalizing the cast. Use `norm_cast at H`"
  norm_cast at H
  Hint "We can rewrite the power expression in {H} using the definition of squaring."
  rw [pow_two] at H
  Hint "Now we apply the function {f} to both sides of the equation in {H}."
  apply_fun f at H
  Hint "Since {f} is a multiplicative equivalence, we can distribute it over the multiplication in {H}."
  rw [MulEquiv.map_mul] at H
  Hint "We can substitute {hx} into {H} to simplify the right side."
  rw [hx] at H
  Hint "In $ℝ$, the square of any real number is non-negative. Let's establish this fact for $f({x}^\{1/2})$."
  have H2 := sq_nonneg (f (x ^ (2:ℂ)⁻¹))
  Hint "Now we can rewrite {H2} using our earlier equations, which will lead to the contradiction that $0 ≤ -1$."
  rw [pow_two,H] at H2
  Hint "We've reached a contradiction: {H2} claims that $0 ≤ -1$, which is false. One can use the tactic `norm_num`. This completes our proof."
  norm_num at H2
