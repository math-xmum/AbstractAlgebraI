Title "Union is associative"

Statement {α : Type*} (s t r : Set α): (s ∪ t) ∪ r = s ∪ (t ∪ r) := by
  Hint "We start by showing that the two sets are equal by proving that for every element x, x belongs to both sides of the equation. You can use `ext x`."
  ext x
  Hint "Rewrite the goal using the definition of set union to break down the expression on both sides. You can use `rw [Set.mem_union]`."
  rw [Set.mem_union]
  Hint "To prove the equivalence, we need to show both directions: {x} ∈ (s ∪ t) ∪ r → {x} ∈ s ∪ (t ∪ r) and {x} ∈ s ∪ (t ∪ r) → {x} ∈ (s ∪ t) ∪ r. You can use `constructor`."
  constructor
  Hint "For the first direction, we need to consider cases where {x} is in s ∪ t or in r. You can use `rintro (h | h)`."
  rintro (h | h)
  Hint "Use the definition of set union to further break down {h}. You can use `rw [Set.mem_union] at *`."
  rw [Set.mem_union] at *
  Hint "For the first case, where {x} ∈ s ∪ t, consider sub-cases where {x} ∈ s or {x} ∈ t. You can use `rcases h with h | h`."
  rcases h with h | h
  Hint "For the sub-case where {x} ∈ s, it is enough to show {x} ∈ s ∪ (t ∪ r). You can use `left`."
  left
  Hint "Now, conclude this case since {x} ∈ s implies {x} ∈ s. You can use `exact h`."
  exact h
  Hint "For the sub-case where {x} ∈ t, we need to show {x} ∈ s ∪ (t ∪ r). You can use `right` to focus on the second part."
  right
  Hint "Rewrite the goal to show {x} ∈ t ∪ r using `rw [Set.mem_union]`."
  rw [Set.mem_union]
  Hint "Now, {x} ∈ t directly implies {x} ∈ t ∪ r. You can use `left`."

  Hint "Conclude this sub-case since {x} ∈ t implies {x} ∈ t. You can use `exact h`."

  Hint "Rewrite the goal to show {x} ∈ t ∪ r using `rw [Set.mem_union]`."
  rw [Set.mem_union]
  Hint "Conclude this case by showing {x} ∈ r implies {x} ∈ r. You can use `right`."
  right
  Hint "Finally, use `exact h` to conclude this case since {x} ∈ r implies {x} ∈ r."

  Hint "For the second direction, consider cases where {x} is in s or in t ∪ r. You can use `rintro (h | h)`."

  Hint "Rewrite the goal to show {x} ∈ s ∪ t using `rw [Set.mem_union]`."
  rw [Set.mem_union]
  Hint "Conclude this case since {x} ∈ s implies {x} ∈ {s} ∨ {x}∈ {t}. You can use `exact h`."

  Hint "For the case where {x} ∈ t ∪ r, consider sub-cases where {x} ∈ t or {x} ∈ r. You can use `rcases h with h | h`."

  Hint "Rewrite the goal to show {x} ∈ s ∪ t using `rw [Set.mem_union]`."
  rw [Set.mem_union]
  Hint "Conclude this sub-case since {x} ∈ t implies {x} ∈ t. You can use `right` and then `exact h`."
  right

  Hint "For the sub-case where {x} ∈ r, show {x} ∈ s ∪ t ∨ {x} ∈ r. You can use `right`."
